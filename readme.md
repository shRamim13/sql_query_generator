SQL Query Generator Using LLMs 🌟
Welcome to the SQL Query Generator project! This tool leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform natural language questions into SQL queries and retrieve data from a SQLite database. Perfect for anyone who wants to interact with databases without needing to know SQL!

🚀 Features
Natural Language to SQL: Enter your questions in plain English, and watch the magic as they are converted into SQL queries.
Streamlit Interface: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit, making it easy to interact with the database.
Extensive Prompts: The system is trained with detailed and varied prompts to handle a wide range of questions.
Real-Time Query Results: Instantly see the results of your SQL queries displayed in a beautiful, interactive table.
📋 Requirements
Python Version: 3.9 or higher
Libraries: All required libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file. Install them using:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
API Key: You'll need a Google API key stored in a .env file for the Generative AI model. You can also set it directly in the script.
🛠️ Setup
Install Python: Ensure Python 3.9+ is installed on your system.
Install Dependencies: Run the following command to install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Create the Database: Generate the SQLite database by running the sqlite.py script:
bash
Copy code
python sqlite.py
This will create a student.db file, which the application will use.
Configure API Key: Add your Google API key to a .env file in the root directory:
makefile
Copy code
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
Alternatively, you can set the API key directly in the sql.py script.
Run the Application: Start the Streamlit app by running:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run sql.py
🧑‍💻 Usage
Simply open the Streamlit interface in your browser, input your question, and let the model generate the SQL query and retrieve the data for you. It’s that easy!

Sure, here’s a simple representation of the Palestinian flag using Markdown:

markdown
Copy code
![Palestine Flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Flag_of_Palestine.svg/2560px-Flag_of_Palestine.svg.png)
You can include this in your README file by adding it where you'd like the flag to appear. When the README is viewed on platforms like GitHub, the image will be displayed as the Palestinian flag.

If you'd like to create a more stylized version directly in the README or want an ASCII art version, let me know!
